# InstaCart_Basket_analysis_using_Python

## Introduction
InstaCart is an an online grocery store that operates through an app. They require more data backed answers to understand their sales patterns. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria using Python and different libraries. 

## Objectives
To analyse InstaCart data set for orders, departments, products, customers and the regions to improve their Marketing Strategy whilst answering the following questions with data backed answers:

a. What time of the day is the busiest in terms of number of customers ordering from InstaCart?

b. What time of the day do people spend the most money?

c. What are the distribution of customers according to their brand loyalty?

d. Was there any link between age and spending power of the cutomers?

e. What is the income-distribution of the customers who are regular users of InstaCart?

f. What is the departmental-distribution of the customers who are regular users of InstaCart?

g. Customers from which region order from which departments the highest?

## Data Set
The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset is from 2017 and contains the following data:

● orders

● products

● customers

● departments

The customer dataset and column 'prices' were added to the original dataset for learning purpose of the Career Foundary course.

## Project Deliverables
The project will conclude with an in-depth analysis, showcasing Python scripting, visualizations using different libraries, and a well-crafted narrative that transforms complex data into practical marketing insights. This final report will provide a clear, detailed understanding of the findings, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning.
